# Powertrains

## Overview
A powertrain is the combination of components that generate and deliver power. At a high level, they are all the components used to transform stored chemical, solar, nuclear, kinetic, potential, ect energy into kinetic energy. 

### Components
- Engine
- Transmission
- Drive Shafts
- Differentials
- Final Drive

### EVs
In fully electric vehicles the engine is completely eliminated and power relies solely on electric motors. In hybrids there are additional traction motors for the wheels. 

### Drivelines/Drivetrains
The composition of all powertrain parts excluding the engine. It changes depending on the wheel drive of a vehicle



### Misc Definitions
- Wheel Drive - The mechanism in a motor vehicle that transmits force and torque from the powertrain to the wheels. (Front Wheel, Rear Wheel, All Wheel, etc)
- Torque - The rotational analogue of linear force
